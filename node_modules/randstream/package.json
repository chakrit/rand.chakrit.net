Essentially no longer random.\n* `01` - A zero-one stream. Useful to use as test streams that is a bit less boring :p\n* `alpha` - An stream of lowercase alphabets. Useful if you want to see the bytes being\n  piped. The original sequence is generated using [`crypto.randomBytes`][0].\n* `random` - Default mode, using [`crypto.randomBytes`][0] to generate data. The buffer is\n  then pushed any reading clients untouched.\n\nThe `defaultSize` is the default size of the buffer to allocate when the underlying\n`_read` implementation is not given a size.\n\n# LICENSE\n\npublic domain.\n\n[0]: http://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_randombytes_size_callback\n[1]: https://github.com/isaacs/readable-stream\n[2]: https://github.com/isaacs/readable-stream#new-streamreadableoptions\n\n",
